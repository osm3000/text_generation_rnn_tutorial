# text_generation_rnn_tutorial
This is a small tutorial on text generation using RNN (and its derivatives), using PyTorch framework

## Todo list
* [X] Add the dataset to the repository
* [ ] Preview the dataset in the ipython notebook
  * Write a small comment about this penn dataset
* [ ] Use a word level tokenizer (instead of just character level)
* [ ] Show the dimensions of the data

## Notes
* The data tokenizer is used from
https://github.com/pytorch/examples/tree/master/word_language_model
