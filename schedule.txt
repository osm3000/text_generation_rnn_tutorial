* Feedback
    - More code/practical (issue)
    - It is still formal
    - Interaction is okay
    - Some permanent researchers (the nice ones) have joined us
        - it is open for everyone
    - People still coming
    - We still have content (good)
    - Going back to fundamentals
    - Review basic methods (like kNN)
        - Bayesian methods (Thomas)
    - Data analysis methods
        - Why we chose the methods that we use on the data?
        - Based on what?
        - Basic question, like: How much data do we actually need for neural network? Based on what we select neural networks?
    - Invite permanent researchers (later)
        - It should be informal, feasible for everyone
            - Either practical
            - Or general
            - But nothing too specific/complicated
